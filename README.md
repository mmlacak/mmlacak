- 👋 Hi, I’m @mmlacak
- 👀 I’m interested in finishing Croatian Chess application and library, then add some bots, and maybe even a GUI application after that.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning many things I don't know yet, or have forgotten. There are very many of those, but I take them one at the time, as needs be.
- 💞️ I’m currently not looking to collaborate on anything in particular, but you can ask if you have a question, or needs assistance regarding Croatian Chess, or my other projects.
- 📫 How to reach me? Best by using old-school technology, like email. Or, if your inquiry is project-related, write an issue there.
